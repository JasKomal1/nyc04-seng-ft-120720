15:25:56	 From Josh Frank : Require is the same as ‘include’ in Java?
15:37:42	 From menachemmargolis : Im still not completely clear on why oop is cleaner coding
15:38:32	 From Josh Frank : Hey Menachem check this out: https://github.com/johnidm/asm-atari-2600/blob/master/adventure.asm
15:38:38	 From Josh Frank : This is what computer code used to look like before OOP
15:38:45	 From menachemmargolis : Thank you
15:42:41	 From Simon Jacobs : names.join(“, ”)
15:42:44	 From Daniel Sasse : Name.join(“, “)
15:42:45	 From Shmuly Levitin : names.join
15:42:56	 From Kody Samaroo : .join(“, ”)
15:42:56	 From Madiwa Simon : Names.join(“ ,”
15:43:01	 From Daniel Sasse : *lowercase* name.join(“, “)
15:49:46	 From Daniel Sasse : There’s also a type in the “name” key of dog2. I don’t know if that will affect your example or not
15:49:59	 From Josh Frank : Wow nice catch
15:55:49	 From nick repasy : will the underscore only work if there is a retuned value? or will it call other past lines of code as well?
15:55:56	 From nick repasy : returned*
15:58:14	 From Daniel Sasse : My takeaway was that it is used to assign the return value from the previous command to a variable. I do know that if you want to repeat a previous entered command, you can press the up arrow on the keyboard to scroll through your command history
15:59:03	 From nick repasy : got it, thanks!
16:18:23	 From Madiwa Simon : can you still do !!!
